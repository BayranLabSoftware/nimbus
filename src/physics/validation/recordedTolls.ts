/**
 * Events with a recorded death toll, and where the simulator lands.
 *
 * The casualty model can be checked against the world, because the
 * world has already run some of these experiments and counted the
 * dead. This is the list of the ones worth checking and, just as
 * important, the reasons the others are not on it.
 *
 * The test that consumes this asks one question of each row: does the
 * model's own low–high band contain the number that was counted? That
 * is what declaring an uncertainty means. A band that misses is either
 * a wrong model or a dishonest band, and both are worth a red test.
 *
 * Two things the harness cannot do, stated here rather than buried:
 *
 *   - It reads the shipped 2.5′ and 0.125° rasters, not the WorldPop
 *     zonal-statistics API, which is finer over a city and which no
 *     offline test can reach.
 *   - It has no bathymetry, so no wave: the coastal toll is absent.
 *     Events whose dead were drowned are therefore reported and not
 *     gated, and Tōhoku is the obvious one.
 *
 * And one thing it must not pretend: the rasters are 2020. Where the
 * population at the time of the event was materially different the row
 * says so and leaves the gate, because a model cannot be blamed for
 * counting the people who live there now.

Beirut was a chemical detonation at ground level in a city of reinforced concrete, with no fireball worth the name and much of the blast vented over the harbour; the severe-damage zone lost on the order of one per cent of the people in it, not half.
